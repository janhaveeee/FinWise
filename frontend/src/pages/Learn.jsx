## What is Budgeting?
Budgeting is the process of creating a plan for how you'll spend your money. It helps you ensure you have enough money for the things you need and want.

## The 50/30/20 Rule

## Steps to Create a Budget:
1. Calculate your monthly income
2. List all your expenses
3. Categorize expenses as needs vs wants
4. Allocate money using the 50/30/20 rule
5. Track your spending
6. Adjust as needed

## Pro Tips:
- Use the envelope method for cash expenses
- Review and adjust monthly
- Be realistic with your allocations
- Include a small "fun money" category`
